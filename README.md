# Genetic-Algorithm
Finds a possible expression to the number given by the user by genetically modifying the expression.

For example, the user gives the program the number 50
one possible solution to this problem is 45+5
another one might be 20+60/2
and so on

The program runs until it finds a solution, then it presents the solution to the user.
